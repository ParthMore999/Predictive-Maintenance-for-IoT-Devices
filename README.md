# Predictive Maintenance for IoT Devices

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance system for IoT devices using datasets for industrial equipment, smart appliances, and general IoT systems. The goal is to predict device failures, minimize downtime, and improve operational efficiency through machine learning and real-time data analysis.

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### **Installation Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive-maintenance.git
   cd predictive-maintenance
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the datasets (as per instructions above) and place them in the respective folders within `data/`.

## Usage

### **Run the Pipeline**
To run the full pipeline for predictive maintenance, execute:
```bash
python src/main.py
```
This will:
- Preprocess the data.
- Train machine learning models.
- Generate predictions and alerts.
